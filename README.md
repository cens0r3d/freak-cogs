[p]cog install freak-cogs vcstatus
[p]load vcstatus
```

## Cogs

### vcstatus

Puts a configurable status line on voice channels. Updates whenever someone joins, leaves or moves between channels, and can show a live member count with the `{count}` placeholder.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `[p]vcstatus toggle` | Turn the auto status on/off |
| `[p]vcstatus default <text>` | Default status for every voice channel |
| `[p]vcstatus channel <#channel> <text>` | Status for one specific channel |
| `[p]vcstatus remove [#channel]` | Drop a channel override, or reset everything |
| `[p]vcstatus show` | Show the current config |

Example:

```
[p]vcstatus default 🎧 {count} connected
[p]vcstatus channel #gaming 🎮 {count} playing
[p]vcstatus toggle
```

Notes:

- Only runs if the bot has **Manage Channels** on the channel.
- Messages are capped at 500 characters (Discord's limit).
- `{count}` counts humans only, bots are ignored.

## Requirements

Red-DiscordBot 3.5.0+ and discord.py 2.x.
